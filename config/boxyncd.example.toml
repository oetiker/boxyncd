# Real-time changes are picked up by inotify and Box event stream.
# This is a safety net for any missed events.

# [auth]
# Official release builds ship with built-in Box app credentials.
# Only set these if you want to use your own Box developer app:
# client_id = "your_client_id_here"
# client_secret = "your_client_secret_here"
# Port for the local OAuth callback server (default: 8080)
# redirect_port = 8080
# Custom token storage path (default: ~/.local/share/boxyncd/tokens.json)
# token_path = "/custom/path/tokens.json"

# Each [[sync]] block maps a local folder to a Box folder.
# box_folder_id "0" is the root of the user's Box account.
# To find a folder's ID, open it in Box and look at the end of the URL:
#   https://app.box.com/folder/123456789  →  box_folder_id = "123456789"

[[sync]]
local_path = "/home/user/BoxSync"
box_folder_id = "0"
exclude = ["*.tmp", ".git/**", "node_modules/**"]

# You can add multiple sync roots:
# [[sync]]
# local_path = "/home/user/SharedDocs"
# box_folder_id = "123456789"
# exclude = ["target/**"]
