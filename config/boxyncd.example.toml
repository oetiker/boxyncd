# boxyncd configuration
# Copy to ~/.config/boxyncd/config.toml and configure your sync roots.
# Then run `boxyncd auth` to authenticate with Box.com.

[general]
# How often to run a full reconciliation pass (seconds, default: 86400 = 1 day)
# Real-time changes are picked up by inotify and Box event stream.
# This is a safety net for any missed events.
full_sync_interval_secs = 86400
# Debounce delay for local filesystem events (milliseconds)
local_debounce_ms = 2000
# Log level: trace, debug, info, warn, error
log_level = "info"
# Maximum concurrent uploads/downloads
max_concurrent_transfers = 4
# Custom path for the SQLite database file (default: ~/.local/share/boxyncd/sync.db)
# db_path = "/custom/path/sync.db"

# [auth]
# Official release builds ship with built-in Box app credentials.
# Only set these if you want to use your own Box developer app:
# client_id = "your_client_id_here"
# client_secret = "your_client_secret_here"
# Port for the local OAuth callback server (default: 8080)
# redirect_port = 8080
# Custom token storage path (default: ~/.local/share/boxyncd/tokens.json)
# token_path = "/custom/path/tokens.json"

# Each [[sync]] block maps a local folder to a Box folder.
# box_folder_id "0" is the root of the user's Box account.
# To find a folder's ID, open it in Box and look at the end of the URL:
#   https://app.box.com/folder/123456789  →  box_folder_id = "123456789"

[[sync]]
local_path = "/home/user/BoxSync"
box_folder_id = "0"
exclude = ["*.tmp", ".git/**", "node_modules/**"]
# Optional local trash bin for remote-initiated deletions.
# When a file is removed on Box, boxyncd moves the local copy here instead of deleting it.
# User-initiated local deletions are NOT affected — they propagate to Box normally.
# This mirrors Box.com's own Trash Bin but on the local side.
# Path can be absolute or relative to local_path. Auto-excluded from sync when inside the tree.
# remote_trash_path = ".trash"
# Days to keep trashed files before permanent deletion (default: 30)
# remote_trash_days = 30

# You can add multiple sync roots:
# [[sync]]
# local_path = "/home/user/SharedDocs"
# box_folder_id = "123456789"
# exclude = ["target/**"]
